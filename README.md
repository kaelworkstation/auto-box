# Auto-Box
<h3> Small python script made to automate the enumeration process on HackTheBox machines. </h3>

The aim of this tool is to kick-start the creation of your terminal enviroment, and creating the necessary files and folders to store your enumeration in.

<p> Keep in mind you'll have to change the path to the directory which you got your HTB folders in. </p>


Specify the name of the machine you're on with the <b>--box</b> flag, and the IP with the <b>--ip</b> flag.
